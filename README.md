# Description

Pyoro (A Python fan game) is a Nintendo GameBoy Game recreated with Python. The player plays a little bird with a very long tongue that he can use to eat beans which are falling from the sky.
Throughout the game, the music and the background change according to the time elapsed and the player's score. The game ends when a bean hit Pyoro. If the player reaches 10,000 points, a new mode appears. Let's have fun!

# Mods

At each start, the game tries to load any mods stored in the game save folder. If you want to modify the game (for more fun), you just need to place your mod (in .py format) in the following folder:
- %AppData%\Pyoro on Windows
- /home/<user>/share/Pyoro on Linux distributions
- /home/<user>/Library/Pyoro on MacOS.
